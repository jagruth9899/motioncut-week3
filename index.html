                <p class="text-gray-600">Given the puzzling scheduling of this series, against an opponent with a core of exhausted players, who were part of an ODI World Cup-winning squad, it's probably not surprising that India are on the brink of already wrapping up the series.

                    With an overhaul of their World Cup team, India are fresher and have enjoyed playing under the aggressive leadership of Suryakumar Yadav. But the opening two games were mostly competitive testament to Australia's depth and a fiercely contested rivalry that almost always delivers.
                    
                    Having shown signs of sluggishness in a 44-run defeat in the second T20I, it remains to be seen whether Australia can rally and keep the series alive as the teams get ready to fly from the south-west corner of the country to Guwahati in the east with a turnaround time of under 48 hours.</p>

                    Decode Politics: Telangana scams used by Congress, BJP to gun for BRS</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">In their campaigns for the November 30 Telangana Assembly polls, the Opposition Congress and BJP have accused the Bharat Rashtra Samithi (BRS) government led by K Chandrashekar Rao or KCR of allegedly indulging in corruption during its tenure over the last more than nine years.

                    The BJP, in its manifesto, has promised to probe the BRS governments “corrupt deals” if voted to power, while Telangana Pradesh Congress Committee (TPCC) chief Revanth Reddy has said a “2BHK in jail for KCR for looting the state” would be made if the Congress comes to power.
                    
                    Corruption has become a key Opposition plank in its electioneering </strong>against the BRS dispensation. Here is a look at some of the major alleged scams which the Congress and the BJP are using to target the KCR government.</p>

                    Lewis Hamilton's telling Mercedes verdict as FIA urged to scrap 'terrible rule</h2>
                <p class="text-gray-600">ax Verstappen rounded off the 2023 Formula One season with a stunning drive at the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix. The Red Bull star won by a remarkable 17 seconds, leaving Charles Leclerc, George Russell and the rest of the grid in his wake.

                    Verstappen secured a third World Drivers Championship in Qatar in October. But had to wait nearly two months to officially celebrate his success.
                    
                    Meanwhile, it was a mixed day for Mercedes. Russell ended the season with a third-place podium finish while Lewis Hamilton came ninth on another disappointing afternoon for the veteran.</p>
